        Q: how to use these tags to structure contents?
        A:  

        * header
            ** nav bar
            (Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.)

        * main
            ** subsections using
                <acticle>
                <section>
                <div>
            ** sidebar
               <aside>

        * footer
            ** <footer>
        
     -->
    
</body>
