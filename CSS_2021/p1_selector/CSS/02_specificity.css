+ hierarchy
    * Inline styles - An inline style is attached directly to the element to be styled. Example: <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">.
    
    * IDs - An ID is a unique identifier for the page elements, such as #navbar.
    
    * Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes - This category includes .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus etc.
    
    * Elements and pseudo-elements - This category includes element names and pseudo-elements, such as h1, div, :before and :after.



+ how to calculate?
    Start at 0, 

    * add 1000 for inline style attribute
    * add 100 for each ID
    * add 10 for each attribute, class or pseudo-class
    * add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element

+ rules
    * Equal specificity: the latest rule counts

    * ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors

    * Contextual selectors are more specific than a single element selector

    * A class selector beats any number of element selectors
    
    * The universal selector and inherited values have a specificity of 0
